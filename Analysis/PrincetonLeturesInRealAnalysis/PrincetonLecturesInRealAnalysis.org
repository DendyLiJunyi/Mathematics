* Lebesgue Dominated Convergence Theorem
#+ATTR_LATEX: :options [Dominated Convergence Theorem]
#+BEGIN_definition
If we have a sequence of measurable functions \(\{f_n\}\) converges to \(f\) a.e., if \(\lvert f_n \rvert \leq g\) this implies the absolute value of the difference of \(f_n - f\) tends to \(0\). As a consequence the integral of \(f_n\) tends to the integral of \(f\).

** Almost everywhere
#+ATTR_LATEX: :options [Almost everywhere equal]
#+BEGIN_definition
\(f,g\) defined on a set \(E\) are equal almost everywhere, we write
\[
f(x) = g(x) \ \text{a.e. } x\in E,
\]
If the measure of the set which consists of the point \(p\) where \(f(p) \neq g(p)\) has measure zero.

# Enter and Shift Enter also works

#+ATTR_LATEX: :options [Almost everywhere convergence]
#+BEGIN_definition
We say a sequence of functions \(\{f_n\}\) converges almost everywhere to \(f\) on set \(E\) if:
\[
\{x\in E | \{f_n(x)\} \nrightarrow f(x)\}
\]
has measure \(0\).
#+END_definition
*Remark:*
+ *a.e. = a.s. = p.a.e(Pointwise almost everywhere)*
+ *Pointwise converges doesn't implies the measure, it just says that on every point of the domain we care, the corresponding sequence converges.*

#+ATTR_LATEX: :options [Measurable Function]
#+BEGIN_definition
A function \(f\) on \(\R^d\) is measurable if for every \(a \in \R\):
\[
\{x \in \R^d \vert f(x) < a\}
\]
is measurable.
#+END_definition

To find some intuitive examples to this definition of measurable funcitons, characteristic functions and step functions(simple functions) will be our choices.

** Integration

* Littlewood's Three Principle
#+ATTR_LATEX: :options [Littlewood's principle]
#+BEGIN_theorem
\leavevmode
+ Every measurable function is almost continuous(Lusin);
+ Every measurable set is almost a finite union of intervals;
+ Every converges sequence is almost uniformly converges(Egorov Theorem).
#+END_theorem

* Egorov Theorem
#+ATTR_LATEX: :options [Egorov Theorem]
#+BEGIN_definition
Suppose we have a sequence of measurable functions defined on set \(E\) with \(m(E)\) is finite. Assume the sequence of measurable functions converges to some function \(f\) a.e. on \(E\). Given a \(\epsilon\), we can find a closed subset \(A_{\epsilon}\) of \(E\) s.t. \(A_{\epsilon}\) is differ from \(E\) with a set which has measure \(\epsilon\) and converges becomes uniform converges on this closed set.
#+END_definition

# When I write these text, I was convinced that mathematics isn't linear. The really important way of learning mathematics is that you meet a definition, you try to understand every definition and every proposition related to this definition, you build up a construction tree, then you got the idea, then you understand.

# I try to use the backwards way the fill up the gaps.

# BTW this also echoes the method in How to reading a book, which states that you focused on the things interesting you.

** Measurable Functions
The definition of measurable functions is a progressive definition, we first look at the simple function.

#+ATTR_LATEX: :options [Finite-value function is measurable]
#+BEGIN_definition
A finite-value function is measurable iff preimage of any openset \(O\) is measurable iff preimage of any closed set \(F\) is measurable.
#+END_definition
*Remark: We use \(F\) to declare the closed sets since fermÃ©.*

* L-p space
** L-1 space
*Motivation: Integrable functions form a vector space which is complete under p-norm.*
